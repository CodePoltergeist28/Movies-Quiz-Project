            <li>TARS, the AI machine in Interstellar, is real.</li>
            <img src="tars.avif" alt="">
            <p>The real TARS isn’t precisely the complex AI machine you saw in the movie; rather, TARS is a giant puppet.</p><br><br>
            
            <li>Emma Stone Wrote Gwen Stacy's Graduation Speech Herself</li>
            <img src="emma.avif" alt="">
            <p>Emma Stone played Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker's love interest. In the second film, this character was in charge of delivering the graduation speech, and she touched the audience with her inspirational message of inviting the students to live to the fullest. A lesser-known fact about this moving speech is that it was written by none other 
            than Stone herself, which proves that, in addition to being a brilliant actress, she is also a very good writer.</p><br><br>
            
            <li>The Hangover was inspired by real-life events.</li>
            <img src="hangover.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The concept for The Hangover was inspired by a real-life incident experienced by one of the film’s writers, Jon Lucas.</p><br><br>
            
            <li>It wasn't the only time Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey played a couple in How to lose a guy in 10 days. </li>
            <img src="how10.webp" alt="">
            <p>Five years after playing Ben and Andie in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Hudson and McConaughey reunited to play a recently divorced couple in the 2008 film Fool’s Gold. 
            There's certainly no denying the pair have chemistry.</p><br><br>
            
            <li>Tick, Tick… Boom! is a 2021 American musical drama film</li>
            <img src="me.webp" alt="">
            <p>The film is based on the semi-autobiographical musical of the same name by Jonathan Larson</p><br><br>
            
            <li>The film had been in the works for 20 years</li>
            <img src="conj.avif" alt="">
            <p>The Conjuring couldn’t exactly be described as an overnight success. In fact, the idea for the film initially emerged 20 years previously when film producer Tony DeRosa-Grund was played a tape of Lorraine’s original interview with Carolyn Perron by her husband Ed. Derosa-Grund attempted to get the project off the ground for the next 14 years to no avail, although he very nearly landed a deal 
            with the production company responsible for The Haunting in Connecticut.</p><br><br>
